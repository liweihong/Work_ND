File: To-Do List

Group: fsoft and varvel sync

merge - commented out cfg_free_basic_blk, need to uncomment out later, set the FRANJO_IS_WORKING
intProc - INCLUDE_SRANGE are not guarding ipSrangeDomain.cc
smt_model - cfg_verisol.c MEMORY_LEAKS is defined in fsm2cfg.h

* SMT for varvel: list all the files and changes of SA, tbench for SMT; Path Balancing; Grouping

Group: Ideas
some new ideas to be trying...

Code Understanding:
  
  Write a softare to generate document from the source code directly?
  Should have semantic info based on some pre-defined APIs, just like
  people read a new maintenance code.


Group: To-Do List

* SMT for varvel: list all the files and changes of SA, tbench for SMT; Path Balancing; Grouping
1. - Do the varvel control flow of sync_branch later.
2. - Document a lit bit of the functions and files changed.

* Develop the installation package for Varvel SMT package, mainly for yices download  

Group: Old List

LIST OF CURRENT WORK:
* by Mid April, finish the witness interface condition/ Assumption
* pthreading on both LINUX and Solaris
	* MPI for parallel
	* Q: can BMC or HBMC be parrellized since there are a lot of static int ?
* Loop unrolling testing/array detection/ PI reading/ unrolling from the end
* Terminate TBENCH when timeout of MES? / fixing the bug on bugzilla, using my_system?
* SMT <=> MIX, changing of Tunelling flow??? call twice of fsoft?
	* Test MIX with Balaced path on MEM-OUT cases
	* Add API for Regular and TSR MIX_HBMC (add mix_ext.h, separate mix and hbmc package)
	* Test Bench generation for this.
	  compute the weakest precondition on this.
* bugZilla(d4) bug 306
* batch mode tbench on distributed mode
* Franjo_mix example for hunter_ project. problem: Internal Error for MES
* ~ivancic/bugs/NIST/890/cleanedArg.run
* 64 bits - with Nadia
