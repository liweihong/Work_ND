The June of 2009

[HARD ONES]:

1. If changing the outgoing guards like this:
     -----------
    | main exit |
     -----------
   /p>0 | q>0 |r>0 \ s>0
  /     |     |     \
        ---------
       |  ERROR  |
        ---------
    How does this affect BMC_NF and Witness Generation?

2. For sync_branch sprintf changes, how does the simpleSwitch/availExpr affect the examples
   of /fsoft/nsoft/headbuild/fromJapan/TP/BackEnd/M/t.A001.c.witness18 in
   /fsoft/nsoft/headbuild/fromJapan/TP/SPRINTF_vs_PICF.txt

3. Merging of fsoft and varvel
   The consistance checking:
   *. For all the compile flag, e.g., CFG_PRE_SLICE in fsoft, make sure it is also in varvel
   *. For all logs in ViewVC, make sure all checkins with keywords (pre slic/preslic/PRE_SLICE) 
      are added into varvel.
   *. For new features with trac item #, check it.

[TASKS]:

Chao - Atomicity violation detection.
Chao - MIX non-linear division handling (fix the bug from Naoto).
Chao - Extend the pthread routines (semaphore first)
Franjo - trac item #1394 for witness generation of assumption propogation.
tbench - simulation on final model when simulator leads to a dead-end.
         It's under CFG_TBench_Load. It went thru the example of ~bugs/01_hui_tbench/ttt and 
	 ~/bugs/franjo/bugWithTbench/ttt_buggy_func. But there is no assignment or true condition on the 
	 webage.
Franjo - Add the constant ONE in cfg_blif.c::cfg_prog_var_latch for tbench to infer the value of vars.
         Hold: per the commit on 7/28/09 by Franjo, the backward assumption propagation is withdrawn, 
	       so do not do this until he figured out a way to set the initial value of vars.
Nadia  - Simulation to dead-end examples at:
         file:///testing/results/srirams-benchmarks/nec-confidential/HolonEnterprise/V13.0/src/ntin/bg_cmp/bg_cmp/Cecmp/src/fsoft/witRank.html
	 file:///testing/results/srirams-benchmarks/nec-confidential/fuse_kernel/fsoft/witRank.html

[NEC]:

10/12 - sprintf cil handling. Solution: 1. update stubimpl.h/.c in bin/config (where is the original place?) 
        2. update fsft_string_checker.h 3. comment out *string_checker.c
	*. side effect: without --cil-edg-plus-fsoft, cil reported error on strlen(). The reason is that
	edgcil will write strlen() to strlen(int *i, str), which is different from fsoft rewriting -
	strlen(int, str). so, no matter what, let's fsoft do first (no matter this flag is used or not).
	Also, for the simpleSwitch/availExpression, removed due to modeling of the error blocks. 

08/18,19 - changed the bmc_nf on merging according to Franjo's suggestion. Run regression and generate reports.
08/06 - Fixed bugs in BMC_NF, including .blf/.nop overwritten after merging; constraint file was wrong due to
        no update on CFG_BASIC_BLOCK::sequence_number_org; group file generation after merging; different 
	process when cfg_mergeKeepFuncBoundary is 0/1;

07/27 - CFG_TBench_Load on simulation on final model
07/10 - Checked in the changes in FSoft into varvel. Franjo's MIX flow issue.
        (due to pre_slice and pi_const conflict, the model is bigger and MIX memout. 
	so no prp file generated for MC)
